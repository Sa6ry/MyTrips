# MyTrips

MyTrips App, is a simple app that allows the users to log, search & print their past & future trips

## Predefined users

The database comes with a set of predfined users for the sake of testing/demo

**Username** | **Password** | **Role**
--- | --- | ---
admin@xneat.com | password | admin
manager@xneat.com | password | manager
sa6ry@xneat.com | password | user


## TODO

- Unit Test & UI Test
- Use pagination while querying the database
- Due to the current limitation of Goolge Firestore, the search is being done on the client side
